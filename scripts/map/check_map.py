"""check_map -- the mechanical and schema tiers for a repo's MAP (`grill-map` output).

    python3 check_map.py [--config PATH] [--selftest] [file ...]

A MAP is a link graph whose value is entirely in edges that resolve and claims that
stay true. Everything here is a check a machine can settle; the tier that needs
judgement -- the same fact stated in two notes -- is the skill's, not this file's.

**Nothing about a specific repo is written in this file.** Path roots, source globs,
section names and the note kinds all come from the config, because every
false-positive run this checker has ever had was a root-convention mismatch rather
than a defect. See `check_map.example.json`, beside this file.

## What it checks, and why each one is silent without it

1. **Links and `#anchors` resolve.** A missing file 404s and is loud; a missing
   anchor **silently** lands on the top of the target document, so a link that used
   to point at one row starts pointing at a whole file and the reader never learns
   they were misrouted. Anchors are the volatile half -- headings carrying issue
   numbers and verification dates get rewritten by routine maintenance, breaking
   links in files nobody touched.
2. **Every path and symbol under `## Code` exists, and the symbol lives in the file
   its own bullet names.** Checking only that a name exists *somewhere* leaves half
   the bullet's claim ungated, and that half is where the defects are: justerm's map
   named `GridId::DEFAULT` for six days after the constant was deleted, and passed
   every gate it had, because the tokenizer never extracted the name at all. A
   bullet naming no path keeps the tree-wide check -- it claims no location.
3. **The section set is complete, per note kind.** Empty sections are load-bearing:
   `**None.**` under `## Governing decisions` *is* the finding, so a note may not
   drop the heading to hide the hole.
4. **`**None.**` sits under a heading.** The sentinel marks several different holes,
   so it is meaningless without the heading that says which.
5. **Reciprocity, both directions.** Every territory an invariant claims must claim
   it back, and vice versa. Not symmetry for its own sake: the reading protocol
   sends a reader to their territory's own list as a checklist, so an invariant the
   territory omits is invisible at exactly the moment it is needed. A vault's
   backlink panel is a different surface and is absent on GitHub.
6. **No note restates a value another artifact owns** -- a decision record's status,
   most often. The copy has no gate; the record's own line does.
7. **A repo `.md` path cited from a source *comment* still exists.** Comments are
   links too, and nothing else looks at them.

## The three traps this file is built around, each one paid for

- **Split on `\\r?\\n`, never `\\n`.** On a CRLF checkout a `\\n` split leaves `\\r` on
  every line; `.` does not match it and `$` does not match before it, so
  `^#{1,6}\\s+(.*)$` matches **zero** headings, every anchor set comes back empty and
  every correct link is reported broken. It did exactly that against 11 valid links.
- **Blank code spans and fences before extracting anything.** Documentation *about*
  links contains link-shaped text. Replace with spaces so offsets, and therefore
  line numbers, survive.
- **Resolve paths against configured roots.** A repo may address its crates without
  the `crates/` prefix, and a bullet may list bare filenames under a directory named
  earlier in the same bullet. Both look like a missing file to a checker that
  assumes the repo root, and the result is a 100% false-positive run indistinguishable
  from catastrophe.

A gate is not verified until it has been shown to **pass** on known-good input,
**fail** on each defect kind, and **ignore** what it should ignore. `--selftest` is
that, as a command rather than a memory.

# It reads `unstamped` because nothing writes it. The `checkup` skill did, and

# Kept as a placeholder rather than deleted: the field is what a vendored copy
# fills in, and removing it would take the mechanism along with its writer. A
# stamp labels and does not warn (ADR-0051); what warns is a consumer comparing
# it against `git log` in the skills checkout.
#
# The config file stays `.checkup.json`. Renaming it would break every consuming
# repo that already has one on disk, and the name is not wrong -- only the skill
